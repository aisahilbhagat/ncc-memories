# NCC Memories ATC Camp...
Well this project took 4 days to build.

But i used ai to fasten it up because i cant waste months on this project. This project was build under few hours only but it took a lot of time to optimize the performace for both the user side and the host. 
On the user side like ui tweaks, loading error, accessiblity, and easy ui.
But if you still dont understand the ui i have also added a hint for you to navigate. 
OKAY !!

And..........
for the host side for me i used netlify it only gives me 100gigs montly bandwidth for the website hosting so i cant let the images load again and again from netlify it will drain the bandwidth too soon so i optimized it using indexedDB and service worker which i wont explain you here but just understand this much that now with the help of those two now you can visit the site and explore the photos offline only ones the photos are downloaded. 

No server btw.

This is open source so you can customize the website as you like idc just don't forget give the credit also you can give credit to gemini 2.5 flash, it helped me to complete the project under this short period other wise i am sure this project would take 2 weeks or more to make which i build now under 4 days.

Hosted by me - ncc2024.netlify.app

also you can remove our ncc photos and add your photos as you like.
